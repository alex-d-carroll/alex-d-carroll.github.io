# Sample GitHub Page

We made a page. Neat.

## Netlify
Netlify was cool but clunky. Simple is best. 

 Goals:

1. Simple
2. Works on multiple devices
3. Fast

Static web pages created that use existing batteries seems best. I enjoy creating docs in Markdown, so any framework would need to support that. Templates would be nice, as I am more interested in the content than the presentation.

## Jekyll

Github recommends using Jekyll with Github Pages, so let's give it a whirl.

1. Install Jekyll, Ruby and Bundler on our local dev environment.  
This is platform/dev specific. I'm using:
* MBP
* brew
* vim
I made sure that ruby, gem, and bundler were are all installed and up to date.

2. Setup publishing sources
I have pushed directly to master up until this point. That's less than ideal. 

Configuring Github pages to look at a specific branch, working in branches, and performing pull requests to merge into the target branch would be more reasonable. 

For now, it is simple to publish from `main`. Github actions will open some doors for us, but that's a problem for future me. 

3. Build a sample Jekyll page

4. Push changes

5. Learn how to preview changes locally
